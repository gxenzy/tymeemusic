## Prerequisites

* **Node.js** v22 or higher (v24 recommended)
* **Git**

---

## Overview

**NodeLink** is an alternative audio server built in **Node.js**, designed for those who value control and efficiency. 🌿
It doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel — it just makes it spin with less weight.
Easy to configure, naturally scalable, and with smooth playback, it provides a solid foundation for music bots and real-time audio systems.

Created by Brazilian developers, NodeLink was born from the desire for a simpler, open, and truly accessible audio server for everyone.

**Full documentation available at [nodelink.js.org](https://nodelink.js.org)** 💚

---

## Features

* **100% Node.js implementation** – No external runtime required
* **Lavalink-compatible API** – Works with most existing clients
* **Optimized decoding** ⚡ – Powered by WebAssembly and native modules
* **Worker-based architecture** – Each player can run in its own process for true isolation
* **Real-time audio filters** – Equalizer, timescale, tremolo, compressor, echo, chorus, phaser, and more
* **Low memory footprint** – Efficient even with multiple active players
* **Prometheus metrics** – Production-ready monitoring with detailed statistics
* **Multiple source support** – 15+ sources including YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, and more

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PerformanC/NodeLink.git
cd NodeLink

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy the default configuration file
cp config.default.js config.js

# Start the server
npm run start
```

Once started, NodeLink runs a Lavalink-compatible WebSocket server, ready for immediate use.

### Docker

NodeLink also supports Docker for easy deployment:

```bash
# Using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or using Docker directly
docker build -t nodelink .
docker run -p 2333:2333 nodelink
```

**See the Docker guide:** [nodelink.js.org/docs/advenced/docker](https://nodelink.js.org/docs/advenced/docker)

## Usage

NodeLink is compatible with most Lavalink clients, as it implements nearly the entire original API.
However, some clients may not work properly, since NodeLink changes certain behaviors and endpoints.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Lack of explicit NodeLink support *usually* means that the client implements the Lavalink API inconsistently, not following its defined formats and fields. Using such clients may lead to unexpected behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> Data was sourced from the [official Lavalink documentation](https://lavalink.dev/clients#client-libraries) and manually updated.
> Compatibility information for NodeLink v3 is still being verified.

### Memory Usage

NodeLink is designed to be memory-efficient ⚡

At startup, it typically uses around **50 MB**, stabilizing near **24 MB** when idle.
Each active player adds between **4 and 15 MB**, depending on stream format and applied filters.

Cluster workers run independently, maintaining their own caches and pipelines — enabling parallel, scalable playback without session interference.

### Monitoring Production

NodeLink exposes **Prometheus metrics** at `/v4/metrics` for production monitoring:

* Audio frame statistics (sent, nulled, deficit)
* Memory breakdown (RSS, heap, external buffers)
* Event loop lag and GC pauses
* CPU load and active handles
* API request tracking per endpoint
* Source usage tracking

**See the monitoring guide:** [nodelink.js.org/docs/advenced/prometheus](https://nodelink.js.org/docs/advenced/prometheus)

---

### Architecture

NodeLink follows a **worker-based model**, where each process manages its own players and buffers.
Each worker acts as an autonomous mini-instance, communicating with the main process only when necessary.
This reduces bottlenecks and keeps stability even under heavy load.

Its modular structure also allows swapping components, adding new sources or filters, and adjusting internal behavior without touching the core server.

---

### Dependencies

Internally, NodeLink combines native and WebAssembly modules for precise audio processing, buffering, and packet handling.
